A **Static Web Application** is any web application that can be delivered directly
to an end user's browser without any server-side alteration of the HTML, CSS, or
JavaScript content. While this can encompass very flat, unchanging sites like a
corporate web site, static web *applications* generally refer to rich sites
that utilize technologies in the browser instead of on the server to deliver
dynamic content.

### A Traditional Web Application

Many web applications rely on server-side generation of HTML pages to deliver
a dynamic experience. The way this works, in simple terms, is as follows:

1. The user agent (browser) sends a request to a web server at a specified address.
2. The server receives the network request and sends its information along to the web
   application.
3. The web application connects to databases or other necessary information stores based
   on the request characteristics (such as the address, user session, and more).
4. The web application uses this data to dynamically generate HTML (for instance, showing
   a user's name in the header or populating a search page with results).
5. The server sends the created HTML to the user agent, which will then render it and
   display it to the end user.
   
Note that the web application itself may use any of a vast array of technologies, frameworks,
and programming languages (Ruby, Python, Node.js, Java, .NET, and Go to name just a few).
What they all have in common is that *the HTML is assembled from dynamic data on the server and
sent to the browser as a complete document*.

### A Static Web Application

Let's contrast this with the request cycle of a static web application:

1. The user agent (browser) sends a request to a static web server at a specified address.
2. The server receives the network request and maps the address to a "barebones" HTML file stored on the
   server.
3. The server sends the HTML file to the user agent, which will then render it and display it
   to the user.
4. The JavaScript in the HTML page uses the browser to connect to data services and fetch the
   information it needs to construct the content of the page.
5. The JavaScript in the page takes the data and manipulates the page's HTML, updating it with
   the data fetched above.
   
The primary difference here is that in a traditional web app, the *server* is responsible for
fetching data and compiling it into HTML that the user can see, while in a static web app the
*browser* is responsible for doing so.

> **Tip:** Want to see if a given page is a static web app? Just use **View Source** in your browser. If you
> see user-specific data or other dynamic content in the source code, it's a traditional app. If you
> only see the basic structure of the page, it's a static app.

This may seem like a small difference, but it has widespread effects throughout the architecture,
design, and user experience of the application as a whole. We will dive into some of the reasons
you might want to build static web apps in the next chapter.

### Hybrid Apps

Traditional and static apps are opposite ends of a spectrum. In between there are many ways to utilize
aspects of each to get some of the benefits of both. It is common, for instance, for an application
to store fully generated pages of dynamic content and then use JavaScript to fetch additional, personalized
data for an individual user.

> If you visit **Airbnb** while logged in, you may notice that for a second or two, the page may say
> "Sign Up" and "Log In". Once fully loaded, the page shows your profile picture and name. This is an
> example of a hybrid app with some data rendered by the server, some by the browser.

While hybrid apps can bring the advantages of both static and traditional apps, they also come with
many architectural challenges. As browser technologies and those that power static apps improve,
many of the advantages of hybrid apps can now be realized in a fully static site.
